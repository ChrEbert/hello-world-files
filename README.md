This repository is about the basics of different programming languages. How can a for-loop be defined in JavaScript?What are the basic syntacts of PHP?

I am a hobbyist in programming. I especially love the way you can be creative and structured when programming. Also the posibilities of automating / make things much faster interesting me a lot.

My goal is to develop apps by the means of javascript/CSS and a database language like sql. I also want to acquire some basic skills in PHP and Java (just for fun).

A big joy would be the exchange with others in terms of development
